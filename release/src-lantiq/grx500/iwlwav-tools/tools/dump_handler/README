This README file contains information about the dump_handler tool.

Introduction
============
Firmware dump evacuation application retrieves firmware dump files from WLAN driver
via procfs kernel interface following a Firmware fatal error/assert.

Script will be run once per radio on device boot after driver insmod.

Usage
=====
dump_handler [OPTIONS]

Available OPTIONS ([MST] - mandatory, [OPT] - optional):
  --card_idx <value>
  -i <value>
      - [MST] card index
  --storage_path <value>
  -f <value>
      - [MST] persistent storage path. For example: /nvram/etc/wave_dumps , /opt/wave_dumps
  --offline_dump <value>
  -d <value>
      - [OPT] parse offline dump

Flow
====
Script does the following:

1. Checks if a recovery already occurred before script has been started (during
   pci_probe, for example) and if so if there is a dump file available.

2. Listens to d-wpal 'dumps ready' event in a while loop.

3. If persistent storage is available application will save a copy in
   non-volatile folder according to the following priorities:

* In debug context only script will check the availability of a mounted USB
  device and use the USB path for saving the dump file.

* Alternatively, the path passed to the script as command line argument will be used.

3. Retrieves files from procfs

4. Verifies magic number

5. Creates files according to the header and creates a tar of these files.

6. Adds date in the tar file name.

7. If already have max dumps allowed, delete oldest to allow saving of new
   ones (unless the files are saved to a USB device).

8. In case there is only one old dump file and not enough space to create
   another one (and leave 0.5 MB free):
   If no dumps were created since dump handler was started or dump file has
   aged (older than 24 hrs) replace with a newer dump. Otherwise, keep the old one

9. Reports errors/milestones using syslog.

Notes
=====
Note: we are using hard-coded paths for the following binary:
/usr/sbin/dwpal_debug_cli
/bin/ls
/usr/bin/tail
/usr/bin/xargs
/bin/rm
/bin/tar
/usr/bin/head
/bin/grep
/usr/bin/which
/bin/cat
/usr/bin/awk
Note: we are using other non binary hard-coded paths, we recommend to check hard-coded paths first if anything fails.
