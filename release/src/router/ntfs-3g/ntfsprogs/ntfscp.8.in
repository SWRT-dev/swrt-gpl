.TH NTFSCP 8 "September 2007" "ntfs-3g @VERSION@"
.SH NAME
ntfscp \- copy file to an NTFS volume.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBntfscp\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIdevice source_file destination\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBntfscp\fR will copy file to an NTFS volume. \fIdestination\fR can be either
file or directory. In case if \fIdestination\fR is directory specified by name
then \fIsource_file\fR is copied into this directory, in case if
\fIdestination\fR is directory and specified by inode number then unnamed data
attribute is created for this inode and \fIsource_file\fR is copied into it
(WARNING: it's unusual to have unnamed data streams in the directories, think
twice before specifying directory by inode number).
.SH OPTIONS
Below is a summary of all the options that
.B ntfscp
accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is
preceded by
.B \-
and the long name is preceded by
.BR \-\- .
Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a
single command, e.g.
.B \-fv
is equivalent to
.BR "\-f \-v" .
Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-attribute\fR NUM
Write to this attribute.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-inode\fR
Treat
.I destination
as inode number.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-min-fragments\fR
Minimize fragmentation when allocating space to the attribute. This is
mostly useful when creating big files.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-attr\-name\fR NAME
Write to attribute with this name.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-action\fR
Use this option to make a test run before doing the real copy operation.
Volume will be opened read\-only and no write will be done.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
This will override some sensible defaults, such as not working with a mounted
volume.  Use this option with caution.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-timestamp\fR
Copy the modification time of source_file to destination. This is
not compatible with \fB\-\-attr\-name\fR and \fB\-\-attribute\fR.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Show the version number, copyright and license
.BR ntfscp .
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Display more debug/warning/error messages.
.SH DATA STREAMS
All data on NTFS is stored in streams, which can have names. A file can have
more than one data streams, but exactly one must have no name. The size of a
file is the size of its unnamed data stream. Usually when you don't specify
stream name you are access to unnamed data stream. If you want access to named
data stream you need to add ":stream_name" to the filename. For example: by
opening "some.mp3:artist" you will open stream "artist" in "some.mp3". But
windows usually prevent you from accessing to named data streams, so you need
to use some program like FAR or utils from cygwin to access named data streams.
.SH EXAMPLES
Copy new_boot.ini from /home/user as boot.ini to the root of an /dev/hda1 NTFS
volume:
.RS
.sp
.B ntfscp /dev/hda1 /home/user/new_boot.ini boot.ini
.sp
.RE
Copy myfile to C:\\some\\path\\myfile:stream (assume that /dev/hda1 letter in
windows is C):
.RS
.sp
.B ntfscp \-N stream /dev/hda1 myfile /some/path
.sp
