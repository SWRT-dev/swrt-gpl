.SH NAME
ntfsusermap \- NTFS Building a User Mapping File
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ntfsusermap
\fIwindows-system-device\fP
\fB[\fIother-ntfs-device\fP...\fB]\fR
.PP
Where \fIwindows-system-device\fP is the device containing the Windows system
whose users are to be mapped to current Linux system.
.PP
And \fIother-ntfs-device\fP is another device containing files which are
to be accessed both by the Windows mentioned above and current Linux system.
.PP
the ntfsusermap command must be started as root, and the designated devices
must not be mounted.
.PP
Typing ntfsusermap with no args will display a summary of command
arguments.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBntfsusermap\fR
creates the file defining the mapping of Windows accounts to Linux logins for
users who owns files which should be visible from both Windows and
Linux.
.PP
It relies on existing files which were created on Windows, trying
to locate significant files and asking which Linux user or group should
own them. When a Linux owner or group is requested, the reply may be :
.PP
- the uid or gid (numeric or symbolic) of Linux owner or group of the file.
.RS
In that situation, no more file with the same Windows owner will be selected.
.RE
- or no answer, when not able to define the owner or group.
.RS
In that situation another file owned by the same Windows user or group
may be selected later so that a mapping can be defined.
.RE
.PP
The mappings for standard Windows users, such as "Administrator" or
"All Users" are defined implicitly. As a consequence a user mapping should
never be defined as Linux root.
.PP
When there are no more significant files, ntfsusermap create the
mapping file into the file UserMapping in the current directory. This
file has to be moved to the hidden directory .NTFS-3G in the root of
all the NTFS file systems to be shared between Windows and Linux. This
requires the file system to be mounted, but the created file will not
be taken into account if not present at mount time, which means the
file system has to be unmounted and mounted again for the new mapping
file to be taken into account.
.SH OPTIONS
