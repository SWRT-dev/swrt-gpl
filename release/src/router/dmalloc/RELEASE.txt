The following set of tasks should be performed when the dmalloc library gets released.

1) Update the ChangeLog file with the release date.
2) Update the version numbers in the following files:
	Changlog
	README.md
	configure.ac (in AC_INIT)
	dmalloc.spec
	dmalloc.texi
3) Run autoconf to make sure configure up to date with new version.
4) Run configure and make now that autoconf updated:
	./configure ; make heavy
5) Update doc files: make docs
6) Consider updating the copyright heads in all files and in chunk.c strings.  Watch for
   .in, .cc, .dist files:
	cat * | grep Copyright | sort -u
7) Check in all files.
8) Run tests:
	- [ maybe mkdir x ; cd x ]
	- ./configure or ../configure
	- make all heavy
	- maybe install the new dmalloc utility to test
	- dmalloc -l malloc high
	- make heavy
	- examine the log file, check version, look for exceptions
	- [ maybe dmalloc_t -r ] to check for wierd flag conditions
9) Clone on linux and others and run tests:
	git clone git@github.com:j256/dmalloc.git
10) Run release.sh script.  It will run tests on repo.
11) git tag the release:
	git tag dmalloc_release_X_X_X
	git push origin dmalloc_release_X_X_X
12) create release on github for X.X.X from that tag
13) Upload tgz file as part of that release
14) Install the tgz file in the dmalloc.com repo
15) Edit releases/index.html to include the new version
16) Go to the docs subdir and run the explode-docs.sh script.
