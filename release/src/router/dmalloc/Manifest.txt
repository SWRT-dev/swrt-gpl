Description of the files in the debug-malloc package.

Changelog.txt		Log entries detailing major module changes.

INSTALL.txt		Installation guide.

LICENSE.txt		ISC License for the library.

Makefile.in		Used by configure to create the Makefile.

README.md		Quick startup notes.

TODO			Things to do list.  It gets longer and longer.

append.[ch]		Local implementations of snprintf and other string functions.

arg_check.[ch]		Malloc routines used for testing of arguments.

chunk.[ch]		Lower level allocation routines.  This is the meat of the allocation algorithms.
			Manages and debugs the administration structures of the heap.  Too large!

chunk_loc.h		Local defines specific to the chunk routines only.

compat.[ch]		System compatibility routines if missing functionality.

conf.h			File of defines for the library produced by configure.

conf.h.in		Used by configure to create the conf.h file.

configure		Configure shell script.

configure.ac		Used by autoconf to create configure script.

debug_tok.h		Tokens that correspond to debugging functionality.

dmalloc.c		Program that assists in the setting of the DMALLOC_DEBUG and other debug environmental
			variables.

dmalloc.cc		C++ routines to help using library with C++ code.

dmalloc.h		Installed dmalloc .h file to be included in those .c files where file and line debugging
			information is required.

dmalloc.h.[12345]	Used to create dmalloc.h.

dmalloc.html		HTML version of the documentation.

dmalloc.info		User-level gnu info manual file for the dmalloc routines.  Suitable as a text manual also.

dmalloc.spec		Spec file hopefully helpful to build linux packages.

dmalloc.texi		Texinfo user manual for generating html or PDF formats.

dmalloc_argv.[ch]	Argument processing library files.

dmalloc_argv_loc.h	Local defines for the argv files.

dmalloc_fc_t.c		Test program for the function checking code.

dmalloc_loc.h		Local defines for all of the dmalloc routines.

dmalloc_rand.[ch]	Random number implementation.

dmalloc_t.c		Meager test program for testing the dmalloc routines.

dmalloc_tab.[ch]	Generic memory table code.

dmalloc_tab_loc.h	Local defines for the memory table code.

dmallocrc		Sample RC file that is used to set the debug flags.

env.[ch]		Environmental variable processing routines.

error.[ch]		Debugging routines and others that provide user output.

error_val.h		General error codes and associated strings for the dmalloc module.

heap.[ch]		Possibly machine specific routines for 	allocating space on and manipulating the heap.

install-sh		Shell script for systems without a sane install.

mkinstalldirs		Script that makes the directories to install into.

protect.[ch]		Memory protection functions.

release.sh		Release script used by maintainers.

return.h		Defines to get the return-address for non-malloc calls.

settings.dist		File used by configure to generate settings.h.

settings.h		File included by conf.h which contains manual defines.

user_malloc.[ch]	Higher level alloc routines including malloc, free, realloc, etc.  These are the
			routines to be called from user space.

version.h		Version number for the library.
